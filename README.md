# Read Me

Welcome to my Read Me on clean and tidy data.  Below are the requirements:

1. You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
6. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

**It is assumed that you are familiar with R and have the appropriate tools to run this e.g. R and RStudio **

To run this project you will need to do the following:

1. Download the data located here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
2. Unpzip the 'UCI HAR Dataset' data into a directory called 'Coursera/UCI HAR Dataset" directory and its subdirectories inside your working directory.
3. Copy run_analysis.R to your working directory.
4. Install the 'data.table' package if you don't have it.
5. Run run_anlysis.R which will satisfy the following conditions:
  * Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  * From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
